# Backend for Lyric Match

Try the app: https://lyricstake4.web.app

This repo includes the Flask application, which works as the API server for Lyric Match.

## Initial Setup

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/driptobhattacharyya/Lyric-Match-Backend.git
   ```
2. Install the Python dependencies.
   ```shell
   pip install requirements.txt
   ```

## LLM Setup

1. Get your own Gemini API key.
2. Create a ".env" file and paste this
    ```shell
   API_KEY=<your-gemini-key>
   ```

## Run the Server

Run the "main.py" file. You may use this on your terminal to do so:
 ```shell
   python main.py
   ```

#### Once the backend server is running, try out the frontend from [this repo](https://github.com/driptobhattacharyya/Lyric-Match-Frontend).
